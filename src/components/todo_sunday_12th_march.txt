Tried to generate security code so that i could do a money transfer: it kept telling me that the security code 6 digits were incorrect even though I definitely typed them correctly.

Then when I went back to the main app screen it told me that my digital secure password was incorrect even though I don't remember changing it recently. 

Then when it asked me my 2 security questions to change the secure password, it told me the answers were wrong but I can't remember setting up those questions so can't remember what i said. 

The app told me to follow the instructions on the web login page, so I did that. It gave me the error reference TSN_0001
